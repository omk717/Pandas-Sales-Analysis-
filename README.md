### Project Description
This project involves analyzing sales data to identify trends and patterns in product performance. The analysis is conducted using pandas for data manipulation and visualization. Key metrics such as total sales, best-selling products, and profit margins are explored to provide actionable insights.

### Installation
To run the analysis, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter (optional, for running Jupyter notebooks)

### Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

•Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the dataset and perform necessary cleaning operations, such as handling missing values and correcting data types.

•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand its structure and key metrics.

•Sales Analysis: Group products by various attributes (e.g., product name, category, sub-category) and calculate total sales and profits.

•Visualization: Generate visualizations to highlight key findings and trends in the data.

### Results
The key findings from the analysis include:

•Top 10 Best-Selling Products: A list of products with the highest quantities sold.

•Top 10 Products by Sales: A list of products with the highest total sales revenue.

•Category and Sub-Category Performance: Insights into which categories and sub-categories are most profitable.
